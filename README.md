# Easy Create - Core Mod

Welcome to the **Easy Create Core Mod**, a powerful and essential addon built specifically for the *Easy Create Modpack*. This mod transforms the late-game experience of Create, adding endgame-tier gear, unique mobs, and custom 
resources designed to give players a rewarding sense of progression.


## 🌟 About the Mod

The **Easy Create Mod** is a **core mod** developed to enhance and expand the capabilities of the Create mod. It introduces:

- **Overpowered (OP) armor and tools**
- **Custom ores, blocks, and items**
- **Challenging and creative custom mobs**
- Full compatibility and synergy with the Create ecosystem

Think of this as the **final tier** of your automation adventure — giving players meaningful, powerful goals beyond Create’s built-in mechanics.


## 🔧 Purpose

This mod was built with two main goals in mind:

1. **Enhance the Easy Create Modpack:** Ensure that all custom features, recipes, and mechanics work seamlessly within the modpack.
2. **Add True Endgame Progression:** Provide new high-tier gear and content that Create players can strive toward, including stronger weapons, faster tools, and protective armor that goes beyond what other mods offer.

> 💡 *While tailored for the Easy Create Modpack, this mod can be used in other modpacks or worlds as long as the Create mod is installed.*
